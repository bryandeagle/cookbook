\recipe{Instant Pot Beef Stroganoff}

\begin{ingredients}
    \item 1 lb. ground beef (or ground turkey or ground pork)
    \item 1 small onion, chopped
    \item 1 clove garlic, minced
    \item 8 oz. white button mushrooms, sliced
    \item 1 tbsp. all-purpose flour
    \item 1 can cream of mushroom soup (or homemade)
    \item 2 \sfrac{1}{4} cups low-sodium beef broth
    \item 8 oz. wide egg noodle
    \item \sfrac{1}{3} cup sour cream
    \item 2 tbsp. fresh parsley leaves, chopped
\end{ingredients}

Turn Instant Pot to saute. Once the pot is hot, spray the bottom with cooking spray (or add a little oil), and add ground beef. Brown the meat, breaking it into small pieces as it cooks, and season it with salt and pepper. Remove any excess grease.

Add onion, garlic and sliced mushrooms and saute for 1 minute. Add the flour, homemade or canned cream of mushroom soup, beef broth, and noodles and stir to combine.

Secure instant pot lid, and turn valve to sealed position. Cook on Manual Setting or High Pressure Setting for 2 minutes.

When pressure cooking is complete, use a quick release. (If liquid sprays from the knob, close knob, wait 30 seconds then release pressure again. You may also turn knob half way so only a small amount of steam is being released.)

Carefully remove the lid and stir mixture. Allow the mixture to cool for a few minutes, then stir in sour cream, parsley, additional salt and pepper to taste.

\recipe{Avocado Toast}

\begin{ingredients}
    \item 2 large eggs
    \item 2 slices of bread
    \item 1 large avocado

    \item Pinch of salt, to taste
\end{ingredients}

Meanwhile, fill a large bowl halfway with ice and water. Using the slotted spoon, transfer the eggs to ice bath and let sit until cool enough to handle, about 1 minute.

Toast the bread until browned, butting both sides.

Mash the avocado and spread it on the toast. Top the avocado toast with poached eggs. Then sprinkle everything seasoning on top. Add as much or as little of the seasoning as you like and a pinch of salt to taste.

\recipe{Mashed Potatoes}

\begin{ingredients}
    \item 2 lbs. Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut in 2 in. pieces
    \item \sfrac{3}{4} cup whole milk
    \item 2 bay leaves
    \item \sfrac{1}{2} cup unsalted butter
\end{ingredients}

Place potatoes in a large pot and pour in cold water to cover by 1”. Add salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are very tender but not saturated or crumbly, 20–25 minutes (boiling will lead to waterlogged pieces).

Drain potatoes, reserving ½ cup cooking liquid if making potatoes ahead. Return potatoes to pot and set over low heat. Gently stir until dry, about 1 minute.

Meanwhile, heat milk, thyme sprigs, if desired, bay leaves, and ¾ cup butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until butter is melted. Remove from heat.

Pass hot potatoes through a ricer into a large bowl (if allowed to cool, the potatoes will become gummy).

Remove herbs from warm milk mixture; discard. Gradually add milk mixture to potatoes, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon until combined and smooth; season with salt and pepper.
